# Exclude specific large files or directories
# Add any large files or directories that need to be excluded below
# For example:
# large-file.mp4
# big-directory/

# Exclude files matching certain patterns
# *.pdf           # Exclude all PDF files
# example/*.png   # Exclude PNG files inside the "example" directory
# **/*.log        # Exclude all log files from all directories

# Exclude specific large files exceeding the limit
# For example, if there's a large-file.mp4 exceeding 100 MB, exclude it from deployment
# large-file.mp4

# You can add more specific patterns or filenames to ignore as needed
