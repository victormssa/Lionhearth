# LIONHEARTH - ROLE PLAYING APPLICATION
Welcome to Lionhearth, a desktop application designed to enhance and streamline your tabletop RPG gaming experience with friends. 
This project, developed by Archei Software, aims to bring the joy of playing tabletop RPGs to the digital realm, connecting players regardless of their geographical locations.
Join us on this exciting journey as we build the future of tabletop RPGs!

## About the Project
Playing tabletop RPGs has been a passion of mine, and I am thrilled to transform this passion into a reality with the Lionhearth application.
Together with the talented Bruno Seixas, we are working diligently to make this application a success.
By utilizing modern and powerful technologies such as Tauri, Next.js, and Typescript, we are creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
On the backend, we are employing Axum along with MongoDB to ensure solid and scalable performance.

The primary goal of Lionhearth is to provide an immersive and interactive experience for tabletop RPG gaming groups.
Our aim is to remove geographical barriers and facilitate seamless communication among players, enabling them to connect and embark on epic adventures, no matter where they are located.
